==========

This is an arduino program to interface with Sony equipment using the
S-Link/Control A1 protocols.

I'm using this to control and read information from a Sony STR-DE635
receiver. You can use [this plugin](https://github.com/robho/hass_sony_slink)
to Home Assistant to include your Sony equipment in home automation projects.
